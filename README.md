## A WIP Python Library for Developmental Interpretability Research

DevInterp is a WIP Python library for conducting research on developmental interpretability, a novel AI safety research agenda rooted in Singular Learning Theory (SLT). DevInterp proposes tools for detecting, locating, and ultimately _controlling_ the development of structure over training.

## Getting Started

To see DevInterp in action, check out our [normal crossing demo notebook](https://www.github.com/timaeus/devinterp/examples/normal_crossing.ipynb), which applies two RLCT estimation techniques to a simple potential. Next, [the MNIST demo notebook](https://www.github.com/timaeus/devinterp/examples/mnist.ipynb) is small scale reproduction of Lau et al. (2023).

### Testing

No tests are implemented at the moment.
